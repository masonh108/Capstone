## Motivation:
Computer Technology and the rapid improvement of computer components has always fascinated me. I also have a background working in the pharmaceuticical industry, which inspired me to relate computer improvement to the medical field. 

## Questions:
1) How much has processing improved? How about storage and memory?
2) What diseases are killing the most people on a global scale? How about in the United States?
3) How does the lethality / death rate of diseases differ in less developed countries?
4) What kind of correlation does computer performance have with life expectancy? With the lethality of various diseases?

## Problems / Challenges:
Finding data related to computer improvement was much more difficult than i thought it would be. Originally, I planned to make my analysis more computer foused, but due to lack of data I ended up focusing more on the medical aspect.

## Technologies Used:
- Python / Pandas - For exploring and cleaning data for use in Power BI
- Power BI - For creating an interactive dashboard
- PowerPoint - Intro of presentation
- Git - Version Control

## Conclusion
We do see a correlation between computer improvement and increased medical success, however, we do not have enough information to say that this computer improvement is the CAUSE of the increased success. There are simply too many external factors at play to pin faster computers as the cause.
